# todo-list

This is a todo-list webapp created with vanilla javascript html and css. The application stores the todos created in local storage, and pulls from and reads from local storage on site startup. You can dynamically create new categories when you create a new todo item, and the sidebar will automatically update when it detects something new. If you click on a category in the sidebar, it shows only those todo items. Hosted [here](https://protojanus.github.io/todo-list/)
